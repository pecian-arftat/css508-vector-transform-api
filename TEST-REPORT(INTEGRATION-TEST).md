\* \*\*Purpose:\*\* Ensures numerical stability and minimal error accumulation across repeated transformations.

\* \*\*Result:\*\* Passed



\#### f. Orthogonal Vectors Remain Orthogonal



\* \*\*Test:\*\* `OrthogonalVectorsRemainOrthogonal`

\* \*\*Purpose:\*\* Validates preservation of orthogonality after transformations.

\* \*\*Result:\*\* Passed



\---



\### 4. Observations



\* All integrated components behave consistently and correctly under combined usage scenarios.

\* No discrepancies were found between Euler and quaternion representations.

\* Transformations remain stable under repeated application, indicating good numerical robustness.

\* Mathematical invariants such as orthogonality are preserved throughout transformations.



\---



\### 5. Conclusion



The integration test suite demonstrates that the Linear Algebra Library components are \*\*well-integrated, consistent, and reliable\*\*. A 100% pass rate confirms that interactions between modules meet expected functional and mathematical requirements.



\---



\### 6. Recommendations



\* Expand integration tests to include randomized and stress scenarios for broader system validation.

\* Introduce performance benchmarks for chained transformations.

\* Add fault-injection tests to evaluate behavior under invalid or extreme inputs.
